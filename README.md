# Hi, I'm Chris

Welcome to my GitHub profile. 

I'm a student in Edinburgh, Scotland, studying computer science at Edinburgh Napier University. I'm due to graduate in December 2021 and I'm **currently seeking my first graduate job**. I'm passionate about problem solving and enjoy learning new things. I especially enjoy backend web-development, Linux, and open-source software.
